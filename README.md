# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game

## Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.


## Features

**Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click on the grid to place their X or O mark.

**Responsive Design:** The game is designed to be responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

**Stylish UI:** The game features a clean and modern interface with intuitive controls.
Winner Detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game is a draw.


## How to Play

Open the game in a web browser.
Player 1 (O) makes the first move by clicking on an empty square.
Player 2 (X) then clicks on an empty square to make their move.
The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all squares are filled without a winner (draw).
The game will display the result and provide an option to restart the game.
